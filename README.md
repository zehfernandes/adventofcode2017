# Advent of Code 2017

In 2015 I stopped at level 5 with very messy code. In 2016 I stopped at level 7
but used tests and linters
[(2016 repo)](https://github.com/zehfernandes/adventofcode2016). This year my
goal is go further than level 10.

Wish me luck ðŸ˜ƒ

### What I want learn in the next days:

* [ ] How to call a especific test with jest cli
* [ ] Use import without `babel node` or renaming `js` file `mjs` (Is it alrelty
      possible?)
* [ ] Learn a good way to pipe functions: `getData().parse()`
