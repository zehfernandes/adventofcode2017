# Advent of Code 2017

In 2015 I stopped at level 5 with very messy code.<br/>
In 2016 I stopped at level 7 but used tests and linters [(2016 repo)](https://github.com/zehfernandes/adventofcode2016). <br/>
This year my goal is go further than level 10.

Wish me luck ðŸ˜ƒ

### What I want learn in the next days:

* [x] How to call a especific test with jest cli
```
npm test -- -t "Day 2 - Check parser"
```
* [x] Use [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) to discover if array has duplicates values.
```
return (new Set(array)).size !== array.length
```
* [ ] Use import without `babel node` or renaming `js` file `mjs` (Is it alrelty
      possible?)
* [ ] Learn a good way to pipe functions: `getData().parse()`
